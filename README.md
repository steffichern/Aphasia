# Aphasia
- **Background**: Aphasia is a communication disorder that affects a person's ability to understand and produce language, usually caused by damage to the areas of the brain responsible for language processing. 
  Individuals with Aphasia may experience difficulties in various aspects of language, including speaking, understanding, reading, and writing. 
  The specific symptoms and severity of Aphasia can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the brain damage, resulting in different types of Aphasia. 
- **Goal**: To enhance the reliability and validity of fluency measurements in individuals with Aphasia by quantifying their behaviors using a combination of machine learning algorithms and statistical visualizations
